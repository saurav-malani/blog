excerpt_text: "The hardest part of solving a problem isn't the solution. It's noticing you've categorized the problem wrong before you even started."

I was building a system to publish blog posts from any working directory, any coding session. The AI assistant I was working with immediately suggested: "Let's put the blog instructions in a global config file that loads every session."

It worked. But it was the wrong solution.

When I asked "what about a slash command?" — a skill I could invoke on-demand — the reframe was instant. "Oh, of course. This isn't a knowledge problem (what should the AI know at all times). It's a workflow problem (what action do I want to trigger on demand)."

The right answer was obvious *after* the reframe. But before it? We were both fully committed to the wrong approach without any awareness that we'd miscategorized the problem.

That moment made me wonder: **what actually happened there?**

## The Invisible Decision

Every time you encounter a problem, something happens before you start solving it. You categorize it. You put it in a bucket. "This is a configuration problem." "This is a performance problem." "This is a people problem."

This categorization — the **frame** — determines everything downstream. The tools you reach for, the solutions you consider, the trade-offs you evaluate. All of it flows from a decision you didn't experience as a decision.

That's what makes framing invisible. **The frame feels like reality, not a choice.** When I heard "the AI needs to know about the blog across sessions," it felt like the problem *was* about knowledge. The knowledge frame wasn't something I chose — it was something that happened to me, automatically, before reasoning even began.

## Why This Matters More Than Problem-Solving

Here's the thing: solving a problem within a frame is increasingly commodity. AI does it well. Give it a clear problem in a clear category, and it'll find a solution fast.

But choosing the right frame? That's upstream of everything. Get the frame wrong, and you'll efficiently solve the wrong problem. Get it right, and the solution often becomes obvious.

```
Solving problems within a frame    → increasingly commodity
Choosing the right frame           → still scarce
Noticing that reframing is possible → the meta-skill
```

Most people never question the frame. They receive a problem, categorize it unconsciously, and start solving immediately. The ones who pause and ask "wait, is this actually a knowledge problem or a workflow problem?" end up at a fundamentally different solution with less effort.

## The Surprising Part: Reframing Is Easy

Here's what confused me at first. If framing is so powerful, it must be hard, right?

No. Once you **see** that you're in a frame, choosing a better one is usually obvious. The moment someone said "what about a command?", the reframe was instant. Zero effort. Zero complexity. "Oh, of course — it's a workflow."

The hard part was never choosing the right frame. The hard part was **noticing I was in a frame at all.** Before that moment, the wrong frame felt like the only frame. It felt like the problem itself.

So the skill isn't "how to pick the right category." It's "how to notice you've already picked one."

## When to Pause

If you try to constantly question your framing, you'll be paralyzed. You can't re-examine every assumption at every moment. Life is continuous — you need to move.

But you don't need to pause constantly. You need to pause at **transitions** — the moments where you're about to commit to an approach. Think of it like driving. You don't constantly question whether you're on the right road. You check at intersections.

In problem-solving, there are exactly three intersections:

**Moment 1 — The Start.** When you first encounter the problem, before you begin solving. Ask: *"What kind of problem is this?"* Not "how do I solve this" — that comes later. First, just name the category. The act of naming it makes the frame visible, and visible frames can be questioned.

**Moment 2 — The Friction.** When the solution feels forced. When you're fighting the implementation, when it feels like you're pushing a square peg into a round hole. That friction is a signal — not that the problem is hard, but that the frame might be wrong. Ask: *"Am I solving the right problem, or forcing the wrong solution?"*

**Moment 3 — The New Input.** When someone suggests a different approach, or when new information arrives that doesn't fit your current frame. This is what happened in my case — the suggestion of a slash command didn't fit the "knowledge problem" frame, and that mismatch was the trigger. Ask: *"Does this change what category this problem is in?"*

That's it. Three moments. Not continuous vigilance — just awareness at the natural decision points.

## Why We Skip the Pause

The framework isn't complicated. Three moments, three questions. So why do most people (and most AIs) skip it?

**At the start:** urgency. You feel pressure to begin solving, so you skip the categorization step. The first frame that pattern-matches gets accepted without examination.

**At friction:** sunk cost. You're invested in your approach. Questioning the frame feels like admitting you've been wrong, so you push harder instead of stepping back.

**At new input:** attachment. Someone suggests a different approach, and instead of asking "does this change the category?", you defend your existing frame. The suggestion feels like a challenge to your solution, when really it's an invitation to reconsider the problem.

In each case, the obstacle isn't intelligence. It's **giving yourself permission to pause** instead of powering through. The pause feels like doing nothing. But the pause is the whole thing.

## The Deeper Pattern

This connects to something broader. In any domain, the most leveraged skill isn't execution — it's categorization.

A doctor's real skill isn't treating a disease. It's **diagnosing** — deciding which category of illness this is. Treatment follows from diagnosis almost mechanically.

A startup founder's real skill isn't building a product. It's **identifying** — deciding what kind of problem the market has. The product follows from the right framing of the problem.

A senior engineer's real skill isn't writing code. It's **recognizing** — "this is a caching problem, not a database problem." The implementation follows from the right categorization.

In each case, the invisible upstream decision (the frame) determines the quality of everything downstream (the solution). And in each case, the experts aren't the ones who solve harder — they're the ones who categorize better.

## What I Took Away

The moment that sparked this post was small. An AI defaulted to the wrong pattern. A human caught it with a simple question. The reframe was instant and obvious.

But the insight behind it isn't small: **the most impactful thinking happens before thinking begins.** The frame you choose — consciously or unconsciously — constrains everything that follows. And the only tool you need to improve your framing is a pause at the right moment.

Three moments. Three questions:

1. **Start:** "What kind of problem is this?"
2. **Friction:** "Am I solving the right problem?"
3. **New input:** "Does this change the category?"

The pause is the whole thing.
